/*
1. Consider the following problem: A program is to be written to print all numbers between
1 and 1000 (inclusive) that are not (evenly) divisible by either 2 or 3. This problem is to
be solved using three processes (P0, P1, P2) and two one-integer buffers (B0 and B1)
as follows:
1. P0 is to generate the integers from 1 to 1000, and place them in B0 one at a time.
After placing 1000 in the buffer, P0 places the sentinel 0 in the buffer, and terminates.
2. P1 is to read successive integers from B0. If a value is not divisible by 2, the value is
placed in B1. If the value is positive and divisible by 2, it is ignored. If the value is 0, 0 is
placed in B1, and P1 terminates.
3. P2 is to read successive integers from B1. If a value is not divisible by 3, it is printed.
If the value is positive and divisible by 3, it is ignored. If the value is 0, P2 terminates.
Write a program to implement P0, P1, and P2 as separate processes and B0 and B1 as
separate pieces of shared memory â€“ each the size of just one integer. Use semaphores
to coordinate processing. Access to B0 should be independent of access to B1; for
example, P0 could be writing into B0 while either P1 was writing into B1 or P2 was
reading.
